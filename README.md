# Pong
This is my final project for my CS50 class. This project is made with Processing 3 and Android SDK files and API 28 (I have these files from Android Studio).
In addition, I need to install Java on my computer in order for Processing to get it running.
My project is Pong and the language that I used for this project is in Java via Processing, since I learned this language back in UC Santa Cruz.
In addition, I watched TekGad's video, "How to make Android apps using Processing (Tutorial)," which peaked my interest with making this project.
Source of his video and in his video, he presented his original source code of the 2D Pong and how it works: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH4bl-5Nxk8&t=219s
For this project, this game can run at 2 specific framerates. 1 at 60 FPS and another at 90 FPS (I managed to get it running on my Pixel 4 XL phone and works like a charm).
To do so, I made an FPS changer (I made a button hidden in that text) to swap the game's FPS to 90. 
Under the FPS changer, it has an FPS counter that show's the game's current and swapped framerate.
I managed to change the colors of the paddles (the left paddle is orange and running with the AI system and the right paddle is blue, which
you get to play).
The most challenging part about this project would be utilizing both Android codes from the Android Studio, to import a sound effect (the paddles and ball interaction),
since Java is the language that both Android Studio and Processing uses, I needed to import the sound effect in a different way. 
For PC and MAC sketches, you need import processing sound, SoundFile, the file that has the sound effect and .play() lines of code.
For using this game on Android, I needed to use some of the codes from the Android SDK files to import the sound effect in this game.
Overall, this game is well made and handles extremely well with switching 60 FPS to 90 FPS. Most impressively me being able to import the sound effect to my phone, 
since this was the most challenging part about this
